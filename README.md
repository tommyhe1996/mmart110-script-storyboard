Our media represents us -- not just who gets cast, but who does the casting, the writing, the producing, the criticism. Yet our field is still overwhelmingly white and male.

The student body you are a part at BCC is far more representative of our nation than is the majority of the media that we study, make and consume. Industry groups often blame the lack of diversity in Hollywood on “the pipeline” – that there just aren’t enough people training for jobs in Hollywood who have disabilities, are low-income, BIPOC, gender-non-conforming, trans or any or all of the above. I teach here because I can strive to provide opportunities that honor the identities that this mythical pipeline excludes, and because this is where I get to work with you --the next great generation of media makers.

Course Objectives
Generate Stories for Media
Generate stories by engaging your personal experience, creative influences, pure imagination and/or role play.
Structure Conventional Stories for Media
Build up & relieve dramatic tension over the course of a script,
Create a central character with a strong desire that drives your story,
Identify scripted dialogue that makes characters feel real and specific,
Describe the outer appearance of a character in a way that implies their inner life,
Develop a script with the main part of the action in the middle, with a short setup at the beginning and a resolution at the end,
Write scripts that effectively communicate your vision for production. For film, this means writing in action, reserving description and dialogue for when they are absolutely necessary.
Format Scripts and Storyboards to Media Industry Standards
Pitch an idea for a movie in written form, consistent with film-industry standards,
Conceive a short film that could be produced by students on a micro-budget,
Use a sequence of pictures and short descriptions that shows your vision for the production of a film as you imagine it,
Write a script that tells your story effectively in a particular medium. In a film script, this means translating feelings and abstract ideas into concrete instructions for the creation of sounds and visuals,
Translate stories into different script formats for different media – we will concentrate mostly on scripts for film, but you will also translate your story to other media that may include radio, commercial (branded) content and/or interactive media.
You will finish the course with one portfolio level treatment and script & one portfolio level storyboard for a producible, 3-minute film.

Academic Honesty
Please know that by enrolling in this course, you are promising to adhere to the following statement:

I understand that honesty and integrity are key components of the academic process. All students, including myself, are expected to be honest and ethical at all times in our pursuit of academic goals. We must respect others’ rights and property and create an environment where everyone can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. No cheating, plagiarism, fraud, and/or lying will be tolerated. I understand and acknowledge that any student found in violation of the anti-cheating policy will receive an “F” for that assignment or exam, and/or an “F” in the course. Other disciplinary actions may also be taken by my parent(s)/guardian(s), my teacher(s), and/or my school, including suspension or expulsion. In addition, my permanent academic record may be affected, which will be seen by colleges and universities to which I intend to apply. I hereby pledge to learn honestly -- not to cheat, plagiarize, fabricate information or citations, assist others with academic dishonesty, or submit the work of others. In sum, I pledge to act in an honorable and ethical manner. 

AI Policy
This document outlines an AI policy I adhere to.

If you have questions or want to challenge or discuss anything here, please get in touch.

If you haven't thought about this before, please consider the following:

AIs are powerful tools in scriptwriting and storyboarding
They can produce something resembling the work of a beginning screenwriter
How do you feel about the possibility that the TV shows and movies you watch, or the games you play may have been created by AI?
You are taking this course for a reason
consider your goals -- what is it that YOU want?
how would using AI help in achieving those goals?
how would it hinder you?
You share work with your fellow students in this course.
You mutually give feedback based upon the presumption that you wrote what you say you wrote, and give you ideas for revision based on that.
My expectation is that you will honor this policy. 

Course Structure
The course consists of 4 learning units, each with their own learning objective and a number of modules within them.

Lecture/Discussions/Activities: We'll spend approximately 2.5 hours together each week at the time and place listed above. This time is in person is requires for the course.
Homework: Expect 2-3 hours on "homework" -- that's usually a writing exercise and sometimes analysis or critique of your own or others' work.
In-Person Class/Online Components
